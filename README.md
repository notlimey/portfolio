# My Personal Portfolio and Blog

This is my personal portfolio and blog, built with Next.js and Sanity. You can find the live site at [https://mkmyhre.com](https://mkmyhre.com).

This project is set up as a Turborepo because I have plans to expand it with more features and applications in the future.

Currently, it's mainly a blog, but stay tuned for more!
